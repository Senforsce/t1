# Creating a simple t1 component

To create a t1 component, first create a new Go project.

## Setup project

Create a new directory containing our project.

```sh
mkdir hello-world
```

Initialize a new Go project within it.

```sh
cd hello-world
go mod init github.com/a-h/t1-examples/hello-world
go get github.com/senforsce/tndr
```

## Create a t1 file

To use it, create a `hello.t1` file containing a component.

Components are functions that contain t1 elements, markup, and `if`, `switch`, and `for` Go expressions.

```t1 title="hello.t1"
package main

t1 hello(name string) {
	<div>Hello, { name }</div>
}
```

## Generate Go code from the t1 file

Run the `t1 generate` command.

```sh
t1 generate
```

t1 will generate a `hello_t1.go` file containing Go code.

This file will contain a function called `hello` which takes `name` as an argument, and returns a `t1.Component` that renders HTML.

```go
func hello(name string) t1.Component {
  // ...
}
```

## Write a program that renders to stdout

Create a `main.go` file.

```go title="main.go"
package main

import (
	"context"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	component := hello("John")
	component.Render(context.Background(), os.Stdout)
}
```

## Run the program

Running the code will render the component's HTML to stdout.

```sh
go run .
```

```html title="Output"
<div>Hello, John</div>
```

Instead of passing `os.Stdout` to the component's render function, you can pass any type that implements the `io.Writer` interface. This includes files, `bytes.Buffer`, and HTTP responses.

In this way, t1 can be used to generate HTML files that can be hosted as static content in an S3 bucket, Google Cloud Storage, or used to generate HTML that is fed into PDF conversion processes, or sent via email.
